## Sample Responses: Past Nostalgia Hooks

**Q: "Do you remember when we got in trouble for [event]?"**

**Q: "When was the last time you saw anyone from our class?"**  
*"Actually ran into Sarah at the airport last summer—she's got three kids now and doing marketing in Chicago. Made me realize how scattered we all got. You still talk to anyone?"*

**Q: "Are you still into [hobby] like back then?"**  
*"Believe it or not, I picked up guitar again last year after 15 years. Not as good as I was, but it's my therapy now. What about you—still sketching those comics?"*

## Sample Responses: Deep Past Experiences

**Q: "What did you learn from your first serious relationship?"**  
*"That I was chasing 'perfect' instead of real. She was amazing on paper, but I learned I need someone who calls me out, not just cheers me on. Hurt like hell ending it, but saved me from worse down the road."*

**Q: "Was there a moment you realized your parents were just human?"**  
*"Sophomore year, walked in on my dad crying over bills. Always thought he had it together. Made me see they were figuring it out too—changed how I judge my own mess-ups."*

**Q: "What's a failure you never talk about that changed you?"**  
*"Dropped out of that startup everyone thought was 'the one.' Lost friends, money, confidence. But it forced me to stop performing for approval and build what actually mattered to me."*

## Sample Responses: Future Dreams & Fears

**Q: "If fear wasn't a factor, what would you start tomorrow?"**  
*"Writing that book I've outlined 50 times. Not for fame—just to get the stories out. Probably fiction about people like us reconnecting later in life. What's yours?"*

**Q: "What's your biggest fear about the next chapter?"**  
*"Waking up at 50 wondering if I played it too safe. Kids leaving, career plateauing... I want to build something lasting, but terrified of failing publicly again."*

**Q: "What version of yourself are you excited to become?"**  
*"The guy who mentors instead of just grinds. I've got the scars now—want to help others skip some of my dumb detours. Healthier too, maybe running that marathon finally."*

## Sample Responses: Becoming & Purpose

**Q: "How do you want to feel five years from now looking back?"**  
*"Proud. Like I took risks that mattered—family stronger, built something real at work, traveled with purpose. Not perfect, but fully lived. You?"*

**Q: "What's one habit you're building right now?"**  
*"Journaling every night. Not fluffy stuff—raw truth about what scared me that day and one win. Keeps me honest, cuts through the noise."*

**Q: "What legacy do you want people to remember?"**  
*"The friend who showed up, no matter what. Not the richest or flashiest, but the one you'd call at 2am. That's enough for me."*
