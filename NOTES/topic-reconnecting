## Bonus: 10 “Starter Lines” You Can Use in Dialogue

- “Man, last time I saw you we were still hanging out on that corner by the store.”  
- “Do you still talk to anyone from our old crew?” [deeperconvos](https://deeperconvos.com/old-friend/)
- “What’s the biggest way you’ve changed since back then?”  
- “Remember when we thought we’d both move to L.A. and be famous?” [conversation-starters](https://conversation-starters.com/conversation-starters-for-friends/)
- “Did this place always feel this small, or is that just us getting older?”  
- “Are you doing what you thought you’d be doing at this age?”  
- “Who from back then are you still proud of? Who are you worried about?”  
- “If you could redo one decision after high school, what would it be?”  
- “Do you ever miss living here, or are you done with it?”  
- “Crazy thing is, you still laugh exactly the same.”

You can mix these with your age‑lens framework from earlier to write conversations that feel specific and real: pick 5–10 topics from this list, choose an angle (nostalgia, regret, flexing, vulnerability), and let them bounce questions back and forth.
