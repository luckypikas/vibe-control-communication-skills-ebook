You can treat “being done” with a topic as a few clear signals in **you**, **them**, and the **conversation**.

***

## 1. Signs YOU’RE done

You’re usually finished when:

- You’ve answered the core questions:  
  - What happened?  
  - How do I feel about it?  
  - What does it mean?  
  - What am I going to do (or not do) about it?
- You’re repeating yourself instead of adding new angles.  
- You’re arguing details, not changing the outcome.  
- You feel tired, annoyed, or like you’re defending your ego more than the idea.

**Internal check:**  
> “If I stopped talking right now, would my main point still be clear?”  
If yes, you’re done.

## 2. Signs THEY’RE done

Watch for these cues:

- Short answers: “Yeah,” “I guess,” “Mm‑hmm,” instead of full sentences.  
- Glancing away, checking phone, changing body position, falling quiet.  
- Repeating the same line: “I get it,” “I don’t know,” “It is what it is.”  
- Trying to change the subject:  
  - “Anyway…”  
  - “But what about…?”  
  - “Let’s talk about something else.”

When you see two or more of those, **offer an exit**:

- “We can pause here if you want.”  
- “I think we’re circling it—want to switch topics?”  
- “I feel like we’ve said the important parts. You good for now?”

## 3. Simple “completion test” you can use

Use this 3‑step check near the end:

1. **Summarize in one line**  
   - “So the main thing is you felt disrespected when they broke the promise.”  
2. **Ask for confirmation**  
   - “Is that right, or am I missing something important?”  
3. **Offer a next step or close**  
   - “Do you want to keep unpacking this, or is that enough for today?”

If they say “Yeah, that’s it” or they shift to action (“I think I know what I’ll do”), you’re done.

## 4. How to stop yourself from over‑talking

When you notice you’re piling on after the point is made, try:

- “Last thing I’ll say about this, then I’m done.”  
- “I don’t want to overdo it—does that make sense so far?”  
- “I can go deeper, but I don’t want to lecture. You want more details or we’re good?”

That gives them permission to say “We’re good” without feeling rude.

## 5. When someone else keeps going after it’s clear

If they’re the one looping:

- “I hear you, and I agree with the main point.”  
- “We might be repeating ourselves now. Want to talk solutions instead?”  
- “I get why you’re upset. Do you want support, or do you want ideas on what to do next?”

That gently shifts them from **venting forever** to either **ending** or **moving forward.**

If you want, I can turn this into a short script you can keep on your phone: “phrases to exit a topic without being rude.”
